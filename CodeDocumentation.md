How to use OpenCV code:
1. In MultiTracker.py, change the variables videoPath, text_string, and sim_text_string to your desired filepaths.
2. Run MultiTracker.py.
3. Select your first object by drawing a window around it, then press enter.
4. Press any key to select the next object, and repeat.
5. When you've selected the last object, press enter and then 'q'. The video should run and track the objects as they move.
6. If an object is lost, press 'x' to pause the video and reselect. Find the "Select Boxes" window and repeat steps 3-5. 
7. If you want to exit the video and stop the tracking process, press the Esc key.
8. When the video ends, the program should end and the text files should be in the directory that you specified in step 1.
